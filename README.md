# Pipelined-processor-implementation-in-C++
Assignment 2 of the course Computer Architecture at IIT Delhi under Prof. Rijurekha Sen. 

Implemented the following :
A. 5 Stage Basic MIPS pipeline without bypassing
=====================================================================
Implement in C++ the basic 5 stage MIPS pipeline â€” IF (Instruction Fetch), ID (Instruction Decode), EX
(ALU execute), MEM (memory read/write) and WB (write back to register)
Your program should have 32 registers as a data structure. The control signals, input and output for each
pipeline stage can be implemented as a struct, with a separate function to implement the working of the
stage. The function for EX stage can have support for some basic ALU operations like add, sub, addi, sll,
srl, and, or, slt etc. assuming instructions have only those ALU operations.
WB should happen in the first half cycle, and the rest of the stages in the second half cycle. Cycles can
be implemented as loop iterations. Total cycles will depend on data dependencies among different
instructions.
Output should print cycle number, first vs. second half cycle in that cycle number and what each
pipeline stage is doing in that cycle.
Implement this program in a C++ file with the name 5stage.cpp. You can test this with instruction pairs,
as discussed in class. Check total cycles taken by the simulator, vs. calculated with pen and paper. Some
examples of instruction pairs are given below:
(i) add $1, $2, $3; lw $4, 8($1)
(ii) lw $1, 8($2); lw $4, 8($1)
(iii) lw $1, 8($2); sw $1, 8($3)
(iv) lw $1, 8($2); add $4, $1, $3
=====================================================================
B. 5 Stage Basic MIPS pipeline with bypassing [3 marks]
=====================================================================
Implement 5stage_bypass.cpp, where you forward input to the EX/MEM stages, not just from L3, but
from L4 and L5. Test this program also with instruction pairs as above, and note the improvements in total
cycles compared to no bypassing.
=====================================================================
C. 7-9 Stage pipeline without and with bypassing [3 marks]
=====================================================================
Implement the 7-9 stage pipeline taught in class, with 7 stages for ALU operations and 9 stages for
load-store operations. Without bypassing source file should be named 79stage.cpp and with bypassing
source file should be named 79stage_bypass.cpp. Test this program also with instruction pairs as
above, and note the improvements/degradations in total cycles compared to 5 stage pipeline.
=====================================================================
D. Report with cycle comparison plots and code quality [3 marks]
=====================================================================
Test files will be shared soon. You are expected to run the 4 cpp files on the test files. Create a PDF
report with 4 bar-plots, one for each .cpp file. Y-axis should denote total cycles, and x-axis the instruction
set number. Compare across the plots and list your observations.
You may use the following 4 sets of instructions for initial testing:
(i) lw $10, 20($1); sub $11, $2, $3; add $12, $3, $4; lw $13, 24($1); add $14, $5, $6
(ii) sub $2, $1, $3; and $12, $2, $5; or $13, $6, $2; add $14, $2, $2; sw $15, 100($2)
(iii) add $1, $1, $2; add $1, $1, $3; add $1, $1, $4
(iv) lw $2, 20($1); and $4, $2, $5; or $8, $2, $6; add $9, $4, $2; slt $1, $6, $7
Your project should use object oriented design, such that the four files 5stage.cpp, 5stage_bypass.cpp,
79stage.cpp and 79stage_bypass.cpp reuse as much code as possible.
=====================================================================
E. Branch prediction for control hazard [4 marks]
=====================================================================
Implement a branch predictor with 2-bit saturating counters and branch history registers (BHR).
Use 2^14 2-bit saturating counters indexed using 14 LSBs of each branch instruction and a 2 bit
Branch History Register (BHR) that records the outcomes of the previous 2 branches.
branchtrace is a trace of branch instructions consisting of the PC at which each branch occurs,
and whether the branch is Taken(1) or Not Taken(0).
Predict varying the start state of (a) each 2-bit saturating counter between 00,01,10,11 and (b)
each BHR also as 00,01,10,11. Predict using only saturating counters, only BHRs and some
ways of combining the two. For each of these variations, your output file should indicate, for
each branch in the trace, whether it was predicted as Taken(1) or Not Taken(0). Compute
branch prediction accuracy of each output file, as (#correct predictions/#total predictions).
Include these branch prediction accuracies in a table in the PDF report above. Each row in the
table should mention the prediction strategy and the corresponding accuracy.
